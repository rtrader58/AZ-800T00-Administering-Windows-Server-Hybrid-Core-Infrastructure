# AZ-800T00 Configuring Windows Server Hybrid Core Infrastructure - Module 8 Errata

## NOTE:  After launching each lab environment use the power commands to restart all the virtual machines with the exception of the Domain Controller.  (reason – virtual machines do not authenticate during start up because they finish starting before the DC does)  

### Known issue - Pasting from the lab instructions in PowerShell does not work in Server 2019 and 2022.<br>

Option 1:  Open PowerShell ISE and paste into the PowerShell Prompt <br>
Option 2:  Open Notepad and paste from instruction into notepad then cut and paste into PowerShell. <br>
