## NOTE:  After launching lab environment use the power commands to restart all the virtual machines with the exception of the Domain Controller.  (reason – virtual machines do not authenticate during start up do to they start before the DC does)  

### Known issue - Pasting from the lab instructions in PowerShell does not work in Server 2019 and 2022.  Open Notepad and paste from instruction into notepad then cut and paste into PoserShell.

## Module 06 – Deploying and configuring Windows Server on Azure VMs
